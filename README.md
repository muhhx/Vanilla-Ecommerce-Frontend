## About this Project
The idea of the app was to build a fully functional clothing e-commerce app, with authentication, payment methods, and as much functionalities I could think of.

- Live website: <https://vanillaec.herokuapp.com/>
- Server API repository: <https://github.com/muhhx/Vanilla-Ecommerce-Backend/> 

## Some observations
- This project is part of my personal portfolio, so, I'll be happy if you could provide me any feedback about the project, code, structure or anything that you can report that could make me a better developer!
- I started this app some months ago, so there are some things that I did back then that I could have done better, such as using Typescript generics with Axios, to type the API response. Regardless, the app is working the same way ðŸ˜Š.
