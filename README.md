The idea of the app was to build a place to share and curate my clothing interests from different brands and collections, so I came to the conclusion that there was no better way than creating a fully functional ecommerce so I could show them off ðŸ˜….

The App includes Authentication, Payment methods, Theme switcher, and a variety of other functionalities that enhance the user experience, integrating it to third-party services like AWS and Stripe.

I also put a lot of time and efford on the admin page, creating a intuitive and easy administration panel to manage our products, categories, collections, and the whole website tbh.
